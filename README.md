## Overview

[cite_start]**DiegeticVisExplorer** is the digital companion to the research paper *"SCORE: A Framework for Quantifying Diegesis in Situated Visualization for Augmented Reality"*[cite: 80].

[cite_start]The promise of Augmented Reality (AR) is to bridge the gap between digital data and the physical world[cite: 84]. [cite_start]However, placing a visualization near an object does not ensure it feels like it truly "belongs" there[cite: 93]. [cite_start]To address this, we introduce **diegesis** as a theoretical lens—measuring the extent to which a visualization appears as an intrinsic part of the physical environment rather than a superimposed artifact[cite: 96].

[cite_start]This interactive tool allows researchers and designers to explore the **SCORE framework** dynamically, enabling the inspection of distinct design strategies across a corpus of 67 situated visualizations[cite: 362, 796].

## The Framework

[cite_start]The SCORE framework quantifies diegesis across five distinct dimensions, moving beyond binary classifications to offer a granular spectrum of integration[cite: 105, 111]:

* [cite_start]**Spatial Proximity (S):** The degree of spatial integration between the visualization and its referent[cite: 111].
* [cite_start]**Concreteness (C):** The level of visual resemblance to real-world objects versus abstract representations[cite: 111].
* [cite_start]**Coherence (O):** The consistency of the visualization’s behavior and appearance with the user's mental model[cite: 111].
* [cite_start]**Referential Context (R):** The strength of the semantic link to the specific physical referent[cite: 111].
* [cite_start]**Environmental Context (E):** The conceptual alignment with the broader physical environment[cite: 111].

## Identified Design Archetypes

[cite_start]Through cluster analysis, the research identifies five categories of diegetic design, which can be explored within the application[cite: 113]:

1.  [cite_start]**Contextual:** Highly diegetic designs utilizing concrete metaphors (e.g., virtual sugar cubes)[cite: 583, 585].
2.  [cite_start]**Integrated:** Abstract data perfectly embedded onto physical surfaces[cite: 590].
3.  [cite_start]**Hypernatural:** Visualizations that blend reality with "magical" or impossible properties[cite: 594].
4.  [cite_start]**Superimposed:** Data that hovers or floats, prioritizing visibility over integration[cite: 686].
5.  [cite_start]**Proximal:** Helper information situated near an object but analytically distinct[cite: 769].

**Abstract**
[cite_start]Existing frameworks often overlook the quality of a visualization's integration into its surrounding environment[cite: 90]. [cite_start]We introduce SCORE, a data-driven tool for quantifying diegesis that allows researchers to analyze, compare, and reason about diegetic design choices in AR-based Situated Visualization[cite: 115].
