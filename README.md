## Overview

**DiegeticVisExplorer** is an interactive companion tool for the research paper *"SCORE: A Framework for Quantifying Diegesis in Situated Visualization for Augmented Reality"* (CHI '26).

While Augmented Reality (AR) allows us to place data anywhere, not all visualizations feel like they "belong" in the real world. This project explores **diegesis**, a concept borrowed from narratology and game design, to measure how seamlessly a visualization integrates into its physical environment.

This tool allows researchers and designers to navigate the **SCORE framework** dynamically, moving beyond static paper figures to explore a corpus of 67 real-world situated visualizations.

## 🎯 What Does This Tool Do?

The DiegeticVisExplorer visualizes a design space defined by **SCORE**, a quantitative framework that assesses AR visualizations across five dimensions. Using this tool, you can rotate and inspect a 3D plot of visualization examples to see how different design strategies group together. It allows you to compare "Contextual" designs (highly immersive) against "Proximal" designs (highly analytical) to understand the trade-offs between immersion and information bandwidth. Furthermore, you can click on individual data points to inspect specific AR visualizations alongside their detailed SCORE profiles.

## 🔬 The SCORE Framework

The SCORE framework quantifies diegesis across five distinct dimensions, moving beyond binary classifications to offer a granular spectrum of integration:

* **Spatial Proximity:** The degree of spatial integration between the visualization and its referent.
* **Concreteness:** The level of visual resemblance to real-world objects versus abstract representations.
* **Coherence:** The consistency of the visualization's behavior and appearance with the user's mental model.
* **Referential Context:** The strength of the semantic link to the specific physical referent.
* **Environmental Context:** The conceptual alignment with the broader physical environment.

## Identified Design Archetypes

Through cluster analysis, the research identifies five categories of diegetic design, which can be explored within the application:

1. **Contextual:** Highly diegetic designs utilizing concrete metaphors.
2. **Integrated:** Abstract data perfectly embedded onto physical surfaces.
3. **Hypernatural:** Visualizations that blend reality with impossible properties.
4. **Superimposed:** Data that hovers or floats, prioritizing visibility over integration.
5. **Proximal:** Helper information situated near an object but analytically distinct.
