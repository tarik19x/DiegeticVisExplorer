## Overview

[cite_start]DiegeticVisExplorer is the digital companion to the research paper SCORE: A Framework for Quantifying Diegesis in Situated Visualization for Augmented Reality[cite: 1, 794].

[cite_start]The promise of Augmented Reality (AR) is to bridge the gap between digital data and the physical world[cite: 84]. [cite_start]However, placing a visualization near an object does not ensure it feels like it truly belongs there[cite: 90, 93]. [cite_start]To address this, we introduce diegesis as a theoretical lens, measuring the extent to which a visualization appears as an intrinsic part of the physical environment rather than a superimposed artifact[cite: 96].

[cite_start]This interactive tool allows researchers and designers to explore the SCORE framework dynamically, enabling the inspection of distinct design strategies across a corpus of 67 situated visualizations[cite: 362, 794].

## The Framework

[cite_start]The SCORE framework quantifies diegesis across five distinct dimensions, moving beyond binary classifications to offer a granular spectrum of integration[cite: 105, 391]:

* [cite_start]**Spatial Proximity:** The degree of spatial integration between the visualization and its referent[cite: 371].
* [cite_start]**Concreteness:** The level of visual resemblance to real-world objects versus abstract representations[cite: 373].
* [cite_start]**Coherence:** The consistency of the visualization's behavior and appearance with the user's mental model[cite: 374].
* [cite_start]**Referential Context:** The strength of the semantic link to the specific physical referent[cite: 375].
* [cite_start]**Environmental Context:** The conceptual alignment with the broader physical environment[cite: 375].

## Identified Design Archetypes

[cite_start]Through cluster analysis, the research identifies five categories of diegetic design, which can be explored within the application[cite: 577]:

1. [cite_start]**Contextual:** Highly diegetic designs utilizing concrete metaphors[cite: 583].
2. [cite_start]**Integrated:** Abstract data perfectly embedded onto physical surfaces[cite: 590].
3. [cite_start]**Hypernatural:** Visualizations that blend reality with impossible properties[cite: 594].
4. [cite_start]**Superimposed:** Data that hovers or floats, prioritizing visibility over integration[cite: 686].
5. [cite_start]**Proximal:** Helper information situated near an object but analytically distinct[cite: 769].
