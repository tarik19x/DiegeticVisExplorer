# DiegeticVisExplorer (Diegetic Visualization Explorer)

➡️ **Web App (start here): _**diegetic-visualization-9fe29b4fb6ba.herokuapp.com**_**

DiegeticVisExplorer is an interactive companion to our CHI ’26 paper, **“SCORE: A Framework for Quantifying Diegesis in Situated Visualization for Augmented Reality.”** :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
The web app is the primary entry point: it lets you **explore, compare, and understand AR-based situated visualizations through the lens of diegesis**—i.e., the extent to which a visualization *belongs* in its physical environment rather than feeling like a superimposed overlay. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## What you can do in the web app

- **Browse** a curated corpus of situated visualization examples
- **Inspect** how each example scores across the **five SCORE dimensions**:
  **S**patial Proximity, **C**oncreteness, c**O**herence, **R**eferential Context, **E**nvironmental Context :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Compare** designs that might look similar under spatial placement alone, but differ in *diegetic integration* :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- **Navigate** five data-driven design archetypes (categories) identified through clustering:
  **Contextual, Integrated, Hypernatural, Superimposed, Proximal** :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Why this matters

Prior situated visualization models often emphasize **where** a visualization is placed (e.g., near or on a referent). In practice, placement alone does not guarantee that an AR visualization feels *native* to the environment. SCORE operationalizes diegesis as a **measurable, multi-dimensional construct** so researchers and designers can reason about integration more precisely. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
