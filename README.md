## Overview

DiegeticVisExplorer is the digital companion to the research paper SCORE: A Framework for Quantifying Diegesis in Situated Visualization for Augmented Reality.

The promise of Augmented Reality (AR) is to bridge the gap between digital data and the physical world. However, placing a visualization near an object does not ensure it feels like it truly belongs there. To address this, we introduce diegesis as a theoretical lens, measuring the extent to which a visualization appears as an intrinsic part of the physical environment rather than a superimposed artifact.

This interactive tool allows researchers and designers to explore the SCORE framework dynamically, enabling the inspection of distinct design strategies across a corpus of 67 situated visualizations.

## The Framework

The SCORE framework quantifies diegesis across five distinct dimensions, moving beyond binary classifications to offer a granular spectrum of integration:

* **Spatial Proximity:** The degree of spatial integration between the visualization and its referent.
* **Concreteness:** The level of visual resemblance to real-world objects versus abstract representations.
* **Coherence:** The consistency of the visualization's behavior and appearance with the user's mental model.
* **Referential Context:** The strength of the semantic link to the specific physical referent.
* **Environmental Context:** The conceptual alignment with the broader physical environment.

## Identified Design Archetypes

Through cluster analysis, the research identifies five categories of diegetic design, which can be explored within the application:

1. **Contextual:** Highly diegetic designs utilizing concrete metaphors.
2. **Integrated:** Abstract data perfectly embedded onto physical surfaces.
3. **Hypernatural:** Visualizations that blend reality with impossible properties.
4. **Superimposed:** Data that hovers or floats, prioritizing visibility over integration.
5. **Proximal:** Helper information situated near an object but analytically distinct.
