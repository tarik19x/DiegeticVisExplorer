## Overview

DiegeticVisExplorer is a lightweight research tool for **examining diegesis in AR-based situated visualizations**.  
It supports exploration of the **SCORE** framework and a corpus of **67** examples, enabling structured comparison of design strategies beyond spatial placement alone.

## SCORE framework

  <sub><em>The five dimensions operationalized by SCORE.</em></sub>
</div>

<br>

SCORE quantifies diegesis along five dimensions:

- **Spatial Proximity** — spatial coupling between visualization and referent  
- **Concreteness** — resemblance to real-world objects vs. abstract marks  
- **Coherence** — consistency with plausible behavior and user expectations  
- **Referential Context** — semantic linkage to the specific physical referent  
- **Environmental Context** — alignment with the broader physical environment

## Design archetypes

Cluster analysis identifies five archetypes:

1. **Contextual** — highly diegetic, concrete metaphors grounded in place  
2. **Integrated** — abstract data embedded onto physical surfaces  
3. **Hypernatural** — blended with reality while exhibiting impossible properties  
4. **Superimposed** — floating overlays prioritizing visibility  
5. **Proximal** — helper information near a referent, analytically separate
