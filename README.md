## 📖 Overview

**DiegeticVisExplorer** is an interactive companion tool for the research paper *"SCORE: A Framework for Quantifying Diegesis in Situated Visualization for Augmented Reality"* (CHI '26).

While Augmented Reality (AR) allows us to place data anywhere, not all visualizations feel like they "belong" in the real world. This project explores **diegesis**—a concept borrowed from narratology and game design—to measure how seamlessly a visualization integrates into its physical environment.

This tool allows researchers and designers to navigate the **SCORE framework** dynamically, moving beyond static paper figures to explore a corpus of 67 real-world situated visualizations.

## 🎯 What Does This Tool Do?

The DiegeticVisExplorer visualizes a design space defined by **SCORE**, a quantitative framework that assesses AR visualizations across five dimensions. Using this tool, you can:

* **Explore Design Clusters:** Rotate and inspect a 3D plot of visualization examples to see how different design strategies group together.
* **Analyze Trade-offs:** Compare "Contextual" designs (highly immersive) against "Proximal" designs (highly analytical) to understand the trade-offs between immersion and information bandwidth.
* **Inspect Real Examples:** Click on individual data points to see the specific AR visualization and its detailed SCORE profile.

## 🔬 The SCORE Framework

The tool organizes visualizations based on five key dimensions of diegesis:

1.  **S — Spatial Proximity:** Is the data embedded on the object or floating nearby?
2.  **C — Concreteness:** Does it look like a real physical object or an abstract chart?
3.  **O — Coherence:** Does it behave according to physics and users' mental models?
4.  **R — Referential Context:** Is there a meaningful semantic link to the specific object?
5.  **E — Environmental Context:** Does it fit naturally within the broader room or scene?

## 📊 Identified Design Categories

Through our analysis, we identified five distinct archetypes of situated visualization, which you can filter by in the app:

* **Contextual:** High diegesis; visualizations that mimic real-world objects (e.g., virtual sugar cubes to show sugar content).
* **Integrated:** Abstract data that is perfectly mapped to physical surfaces (e.g., heatmaps on a floor).
* **Hypernatural:** "Magical" visualizations that blend reality with impossible properties (e.g., a glowing path).
* **Superimposed:** Data that hovers over the world, often prioritizing visibility over realism.
* **Proximal:** Helper information (like charts or text) placed near an object but clearly separate from it.
