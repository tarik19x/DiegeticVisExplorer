## Overview

DiegeticVisExplorer is an interactive companion tool for the research paper *SCORE: A Framework for Quantifying Diegesis in Situated Visualization for Augmented Reality*.

While Augmented Reality (AR) allows us to place data anywhere, not all visualizations feel like they "belong" in the real world. This project explores diegesis, a concept borrowed from narratology and game design, to measure how seamlessly a visualization integrates into its physical environment. This tool allows researchers and designers to navigate the SCORE framework dynamically, moving beyond static paper figures to explore a corpus of 67 real-world situated visualizations.

## Interactive Exploration

The DiegeticVisExplorer plots 67 visualizations in a 3D space where the axes represent the five dimensions of diegesis, such as spatial proximity and environmental context. Users can filter by category—for example, Contextual or Hypernatural—to observe how different dimensions influence each design strategy. The plot supports dynamic rotation to explore these relationships, while clicking on a visualization reveals its specific details and rationale across all five dimensions.

## The Framework

The SCORE framework quantifies diegesis across five distinct dimensions, moving beyond binary classifications to offer a granular spectrum of integration:

* **Spatial Proximity:** The degree of spatial integration between the visualization and its referent.
* **Concreteness:** The level of visual resemblance to real-world objects versus abstract representations.
* **Coherence:** The consistency of the visualization's behavior and appearance with the user's mental model.
* **Referential Context:** The strength of the semantic link to the specific physical referent.
* **Environmental Context:** The conceptual alignment with the broader physical environment.

## Identified Design Archetypes

Through cluster analysis, the research identifies five categories of diegetic design which can be explored within the application:

1. **Contextual:** Highly diegetic designs utilizing concrete metaphors.
2. **Integrated:** Abstract data perfectly embedded onto physical surfaces.
3. **Hypernatural:** Visualizations that blend reality with impossible properties.
4. **Superimposed:** Data that hovers or floats, prioritizing visibility over integration.
5. **Proximal:** Helper information situated near an object but analytically distinct.
